Main Idea:
Defense of the Planet Xor is a top down space themed shooter.
The game is played all through command line, with the user giving
commands to control the ship.
The goal of the game is to make it so no enemy reached the bottom
of the screen.

Implementation:
The program will be self contained in a main, header, and function files.
Almost every action of the game will be done through function calls, with the 
exception of a few loops.
//Launch
When launching the program, a function will be called to give a title screen
showing a logo graphic for the game, as well as then giving a text based
story narrative. (Think opening crawl for Star Wars)
//Game Start
After launching, the user will be loaded into the game world.
The user will see the main map, as shown below, which displays the current
score, high score, and game board.
//Example Map:
-------------------------
Score: 35  High Score: 55

-------------------------
//Movement
There are 4 commands in the game. < for moving left, > for moving right,
f for fire, and q to quit. Every time a command is carried out, the 
enemy ships (X) will move down one space. This can be countered if the
player aligns their ship (^) underneath the enemy and fires. This will destroy
the first enemy ship the bullet comes in contact with, awarding the player 
5 points. The game is lost if the player runs into an enemy or if an enemy
goes past the end of the board.

while(quit or lostgame) {
  displayBoard();
  choice = getkey();


  waitt 50 ms


  if(getKey is valid move) {
    move player or fire
  }

  endTurn()
